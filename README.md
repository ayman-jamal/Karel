# Karel Assignment



## ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a solution using Karel to divide a map into chambers based on rows (`n`) and columns (`m`). Karel navigates through the grid, placing beepers to create dividers. The division of chambers is done efficiently, with an emphasis on optimizing the number of beepers placed using various zigzag and divider patterns.

## ðŸ§© Key Assumptions:
- **n**: Number of rows
- **m**: Number of columns
- Chambers are defined based on the number of dots they contain. The number of dots relates to Karel's utilization, with one dot being used at a time.

## ðŸ§  Logic and Cases

1. **n > 2 && m > 2:**
   - For larger maps, various patterns like `zigZagDivider()`, `V_ZigZag()`, and `H_ZigZag()` are used.
   - Example:
     - `n = m`: Map 10x10
     - `n != m`: Map 16x12

2. **n = 2 && m = 2:**
   - Manages smaller maps with equal dimensions (2x2).

3. **(n = 1 + m > 1) || (n > 1 + m = 1):**
   - Handles cases where one dimension equals 1, and the other is greater than 1.
   - Padding logic is used for maps divisible by 4 to ensure proper division.

4. **n = 2 + m > 6 || n > 6 + m = 2:**
   - For maps where one dimension is 2 and the other is greater than 6.

5. **n = 2 + m <= 6 || n <= 6 + m = 2:**
   - Small maps are handled using a simple zigzag pattern (`specialZigZag(n, m)`).

## ðŸ”„ Map Divider Strategy

Karel moves through the grid using the following logic:
- **Zigzag patterns**: To optimize beeper placement in larger maps.
- **Padding method**: To divide maps into equal chambers when one dimension is divisible by 4.
- **Simple Divider**: For smaller maps or dimensions less than 6.

The goal is to ensure minimal beeper usage while dividing the map into as many chambers as possible.

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion
This project highlights efficient map division using various patterns to minimize the number of beepers required. By applying logical methods and edge-case handling, the map is divided into chambers, even under non-standard dimensions. The code is structured to handle special cases and irregular map sizes, ensuring maximum efficiency in beeper placement.
